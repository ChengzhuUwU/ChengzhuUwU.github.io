The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven the development of system-on-a-chip (SoC) technology for embedded and mobile systems, which may define the future of next-generation computation. In SoC devices, efficient cloth and deformable body simulations require parallelized, heterogeneous computation across multiple processing units. The key challenge in heterogeneous computation lies in task distribution, which must account for varying inter-task dependencies and communication costs. 

This paper proposes a novel framework for automated task scheduling to optimize simulation performance by minimizing communication overhead and aligning tasks with the specific strengths of each device. To achieve this, we introduce an efficient scheduling method based on the Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) algorithm, adapted for hybrid systems. We model simulation tasks—such as those in iterative methods like Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel—as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). 

To maximize the parallelism of nonlinear Gauss-Seidel simulation tasks, we present an innovative asynchronous Gauss-Seidel method with specialized data synchronization across units. Additionally, we employ task merging and tailored task-sorting strategies for Gauss-Seidel tasks to achieve an optimal balance between convergence and efficiency. 

We validate the effectiveness of our framework across various simulations, including XPBD, vertex block descent, and second-order stencil descent, using Apple M-series processors with both CPU and GPU cores. By maximizing computational efficiency and reducing processing times, our method achieves superior simulation frame rates compared to approaches that rely on individual devices in isolation.
